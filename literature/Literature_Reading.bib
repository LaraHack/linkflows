Knowledge of these 'serendipity patterns' ight help in expecting also the unexpected and in finding also the unsought.},

  Abstract                 = {The ever growing amount of Semantic Web data has made it increasingly difficult to analyse the information required by the users. Association rule mining is one of the most useful techniques for discovering frequent patterns among RDF triples. In this context, some statistical methods strongly rely on the user intervention that is time-consuming and error-prone due to a large amount of data. In these studies, the rule quality factors (e.g. Support and Confidence measures) consider only knowledge in the instance-level data. However, Semantic Web data contains knowledge in both instance-level and schema-level. In this paper, we introduce an approach called SWARM (Semantic Web Association Rule Mining) to automatically mine Semantic Association Rules from RDF data. We discuss how to utilize knowledge encode in the schema-level to enrich the semantics of rules. We also show that our approach is able to reveal common behavioral patterns associated with knowledge in the instance-level and schema-level. The proposed rule quality factors (Support and Confidence) consider knowledge not only in the instance-level but also schema-level. Experiments performed on the DBpedia Dataset (3.8) demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {When building a recommender system, how can we ensure
that all items are modeled well? Classically, recommender
systems are built, optimized, and tuned to improve a global
prediction objective, such as root mean squared error. How-
ever, as we demonstrate, these recommender systems of-
ten leave many items badly-modeled and thus under-served.
Further, we give both empirical and theoretical evidence
that no single matrix factorization, under current state-of-
the-art methods, gives optimal results for each item.
As a result, we ask: how can we learn additional mod-
els to improve the recommendation quality for a specified
subset of items? We offer a new technique called focused
learning, based on hyperparameter optimization and a cus-
tomized matrix factorization objective. Applying focused
learning on top of weighted matrix factorization, factoriza-
tion machines, and LLORMA, we demonstrate prediction
accuracy improvements on multiple datasets. For instance,
on MovieLens we achieve as much as a 17\% improvement in
prediction accuracy for niche movies, cold-start items, and
even the most badly-modeled items in the original model.},

Similar to cartographic maps of our world, the map of science provides a bird’s eye view of today`s scientific landscape. It can be used to visually identify major areas of science, their size, similarity, and interconnectedness. In order to be useful, the map needs to be accurate on a local and on a global scale. While our recent work has focused on the former aspect,1 this paper summarizes results on how to achieve structural accuracy. Eight alternative measures of journal similarity were applied to a data set of 7,121 journals covering over 1 million documents in the combined Science Citation and Social Science Citation Indexes. For each journal similarity measure we generated two-dimensional spatial layouts using the force-directed graph layout tool, VxOrd. Next, mutual information values were calculated for each graph at different clustering levels to give a measure of structural accuracy for each map. The best co-citation and inter-citation maps according to local and structural accuracy were selected and are presented and characterized. These two maps are compared to establish robustness. The inter-citation map is then used to examine linkages between disciplines. Biochemistry appears as the most interdisciplinary discipline in science.},

  Abstract                 = {Most literature searching in biomedicine is now conducted via PubMed, Google
Scholar or other web-based bibliographic search mechanisms. Yet until now a public, open,
interoperable and complete web-adapted information schema for bibliographic citations,
bibliographic references and scientific discourse has not been available. Such a schema,
expressed in the form of a description logic compatible with current web semantics approaches,
would provide the ability to treat bibliographic references and citations, and rhetorical discourse
in scientific publications, as semantic metadata on the web, with all the benefits that implies for
organization, search and mash-up of web-based scientific information.
In this paper we present CiTO + SWAN, a set of fully harmonized ontology modules resulting
from the harmonization of CiTO (the Citation Typing Ontology) with SWAN (Semantic Web
Applications in Neuromedicine), which we have developed by jointly adapting and evolving
version 1.6 of CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, and version 1.2 of the SWAN Scientific
Discourse Ontology (v1.2). The CiTO + SWAN model is specified in OWL 2 DL, is fully
modular, and inherently supports agent-based searching and mash-ups.
Through the harmonization activity presented here, and previous work that harmonized SWAN
with the SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities) Ontology for describing blogs,
wikis and discussion groups, we have construct the basis of a powerful new web framework for
scientific communications.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: Scientific publications are documentary representations of defeasible arguments, supported by data
and repeatable methods. They are the essential mediating artifacts in the ecosystem of scientific communications.
The institutional “goal” of science is publishing results. The linear document publication format, dating from 1665,
has survived transition to the Web.
Intractable publication volumes; the difficulty of verifying evidence; and observed problems in evidence and
citation chains suggest a need for a web-friendly and machine-tractable model of scientific publications. This model
should support: digital summarization, evidence examination, challenge, verification and remix, and incremental
adoption. Such a model must be capable of expressing a broad spectrum of representational complexity, ranging
from minimal to maximal forms.
Results: The micropublications semantic model of scientific argument and evidence provides these features.
Micropublications support natural language statements; data; methods and materials specifications; discussion and
commentary; challenge and disagreement; as well as allowing many kinds of statement formalization.
The minimal form of a micropublication is a statement with its attribution. The maximal form is a statement with its
complete supporting argument, consisting of all relevant evidence, interpretations, discussion and challenges
brought forward in support of or opposition to it. Micropublications may be formalized and serialized in multiple
ways, including in RDF. They may be added to publications as stand-off metadata.
An OWL 2 vocabulary for micropublications is available at http://purl.org/mp. A discussion of this vocabulary along
with RDF examples from the case studies, appears as OWL Vocabulary and RDF Examples in Additional file 1.
Conclusion: Micropublications, because they model evidence and allow qualified, nuanced assertions, can play
essential roles in the scientific communications ecosystem in places where simpler, formalized and purely
statement-based models, such as the nanopublications model, will not be sufficient. At the same time they will add
significant value to, and are intentionally compatible with, statement-based formalizations.
We suggest that micropublications, generated by useful software tools supporting such activities as writing, editing,
reviewing, and discussion, will be of great value in improving the quality and tractability of biomedical
communications.},

Data publishers often do not have the means to identify quality problems in their data. To make the task for both stakeholders easier, we have developed the Dataset Quality Ontology (daQ). daQ is a core vocabulary for representing the results of quality benchmarking of a linked dataset. It represents quality metadata as multi-dimensional and statistical observations using the Data Cube vocabulary. Quality metadata are organised as a self-contained graph, which can, e.g., be embedded into linked open datasets. We discuss the design considerations, give examples for extending daQ by custom quality metrics, and present use cases such as analysing data versions, browsing datasets by quality, and link identification. We finally discuss how data cube visualisation tools enable data publishers and consumers to analyse better the quality of their data.},

provides new insights and a deeper under-
standing of the examined techniques. We
identify five aspects that can influence the
outcomes of experiments that are typically
not addressed in research papers. Our use
cases show that these aspects may change

us to conclude that more care should be

documents are abstract objects with the fact that they can undergo change. In this paper we present an
account of documents which we believe is quite common, but which was not discussed by Renear
and Wickett.
According to this account documents are indeed abstract objects, but this is easily reconciled with the
fact that they are created and can undergo change. We then point to a similarity between this account
and the notion of so-called space-time slices. We argue that the proposed account of documents as
timed abstract objects may be subject to the same kind of criticism that has been raised against the
notion of space-time slices.
We believe that our account fares no worse than the other accounts given of documents as abstract
objects. But it still fails, and we remain agnostic about the ontological status of documents and their
relation to abstract objects, as well as about the nature of abstract objects. We conclude that either
documents are not (or not related to) abstract objects, or they are (or are related to) abstract objects of
a kind which does not correspond to the standard definition of what an abstract object is.},

This paper introduces OWiki, a framework for creating ontological content within not-natively-semantic wikis. Ontology-driven forms and templates are the key concepts of the system, that allows even inexpert users to create consistent semantic data with little effort. Multiple and very different instances of OWiki are presented here. The expressive power and flexibility of OWiki proved to be the right trade-off to deploy the authoring environments for such very different domains, ensuring at the same time editing freedom and semantic data consistency.},

On the contrary, overlaps have started to appear in a large number of incredibly popular applications hidden under the guise of syntactical tricks to the basic hierarchy of the XML data format. Unfortunately, syntactical tricks have the drawback that the affected structures require complicated workarounds to support even the simplest query or usage. In this article, we present Extremely Annotational Resource Description Framework (RDF) Markup (EARMARK), an approach to overlapping markup that simplifies and streamlines the management of multiple hierarchies on the same content, and provides an approach to sophisticated queries and usages over such structures without the need of ad-hoc applications, simply by using Semantic Web tools and languages. We compare how relevant tasks (e.g., the identification of the contribution of an author in a word processor document) are of some substantial complexity when using the original data format and become more or less trivial when using EARMARK. We finally evaluate positively the memory and disk requirements of EARMARK documents in comparison to Open Office and Microsoft Word XML-based formats.},

additional (semantic) markup into web documents. Yet, little attention is being
paid to the possibility of expressing the actual structures of the documents in a
form suitable for the semantic web. EARMARK is a model for explicitly
expressing structural assertions of markup and documents, allowing a
straightforward integration of the semantics of the markup and the semantics of
the content. The well-formedness of a hierarchy, for instance, becomes an
explicit assertion and similarly the analysis of the validity of markup structures
become matter for further semantic analysis. This paper describes EARMARK
and shows a framework for using OWL ontologies, that implement particular
markup properties, to demonstrate the compliance of EARMARK documents
with those properties.},

The proposed extension uses English sentences to represent informal and underspecified scientific claims. These sentences follow a syntactic and semantic scheme that we call AIDA (Atomic, Independent, Declarative, Absolute), which provides a uniform and succinct representation of scientific assertions. Such AIDA nanopublications are compatible with the existing nanopublication concept and enjoy most of its advantages such as information sharing, interlinking of scientific findings, and detailed attribution, while being more flexible and applicable to a much wider range of scientific results. We show that users are able to create AIDA sentences for given scientific results quickly and at high quality, and that it is feasible to automatically extract and interlink AIDA nanopublications from existing unstructured data sources. To demonstrate our approach, a web-based interface is introduced, which also exemplifies the use of nanopublications for non-scientific content, including meta-nanopublications that describe other nanopublications.},

For digital artifacts that are supposed to be immutable, there is moreover no commonly accepted method to enforce this immutability. These shortcomings have a serious negative impact on the ability to reproduce the results of processes that rely on Web resources, which in turn heavily impacts areas such as science where reproducibility is important. To solve this problem, we propose trusty URIs containing cryptographic hash values. We show how trusty URIs can be used for the verification of digital artifacts, in a manner that is independent of the serialization format in the case of structured data files such as nanopublications. We demonstrate how the contents of these files become immutable, including dependencies to external digital artifacts and thereby extending the range of verifiability to the entire reference tree. Our approach sticks to the core principles of the Web, namely openness and decentralized architecture, and is fully compatible with existing standards and protocols.

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a model to operationalise serendipity
in content-based recommender systems. The model, called
SIRUP, is inspired by the Silvia’s curiosity theory, based on
the fundamental theory of Berlyne, aims at (1) measuring the
novelty of an item with respect to the user profile, and (2)
assessing whether the user is able to manage such level of
novelty (coping potential). The novelty of items is calculated
with cosine similarities between items, using Linked Open
Data paths. The coping potential of users is estimated by
measuring the diversity of the items in the user profile. We
deployed and evaluated the SIRUP model in a use case with
TV recommender using BBC programs dataset. Results show
that the SIRUP model allows us to identify serendipitous rec-
ommendations, and, at the same time, to have 71\% precision.},

  Abstract                 = {Introduction

Along with the proliferation of Open Access (OA) publishing, the interest for comparing the scientific quality of studies published in OA journals versus subscription journals has also increased. With our study we aimed to compare the methodological quality and the quality of reporting of primary epidemiological studies and systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in OA and non-OA journals.

Methods

In order to identify the studies to appraise, we listed all OA and non-OA journals which published in 2013 at least one primary epidemiologic study (case-control or cohort study design), and at least one systematic review or meta-analysis in the field of oncology. For the appraisal, we picked up the first studies published in 2013 with case-control or cohort study design from OA journals (Group A; n = 12), and in the same time period from non-OA journals (Group B; n = 26); the first systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in 2013 from OA journals (Group C; n = 15), and in the same time period from non-OA journals (Group D; n = 32). We evaluated the methodological quality of studies by assessing the compliance of case-control and cohort studies to Newcastle and Ottawa Scale (NOS) scale, and the compliance of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) scale. The quality of reporting was assessed considering the adherence of case-control and cohort studies to STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist, and the adherence of systematic reviews and meta-analyses to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist.

Results

Among case-control and cohort studies published in OA and non-OA journals, we did not observe significant differences in the median value of NOS score (Group A: 7 (IQR 7–8) versus Group B: 8 (7–9); p = 0.5) and in the adherence to STROBE checklist (Group A, 75\% versus Group B, 80\%; p = 0.1). The results did not change after adjustment for impact factor. The compliance with AMSTAR and adherence to PRISMA checklist were comparable between systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in OA and non-OA journals (Group C, 46.0\% versus Group D, 55.0\%; p = 0.06), (Group C, 72.0\% versus Group D, 76.0\%; p = 0.1), respectively).

Conclusion

The epidemiological studies published in OA journals in the field of oncology approach the same methodological quality and quality of reporting as studies published in non-OA journals.},

for the semantic interpretation of linguistic expressions that
use markup in their structuring and for enabling sophisti-
cated operation on markup documents, such as semantic
validation, multi-format document conversion and searching
on heterogeneous digital libraries. The semantics of XML-
based markup languages is usually provided informally, for
example through textual descriptions in the specification of
the language. While the syntax of XML-based languages is
entirely machine-readable, its semantics is obscure for ma-
chines. Semantic Web technologies can be useful for filling
the gap between the well-defined syntax of a language and
the informal specification of its semantics. In this paper
we show how to integrate LMM, an OWL vocabulary that
represents some core semiotic notions, with EARMARK, a
model for the specification of semantic and structural char-
acteristics of markup languages, in order to provide a better
understanding of the semantics of markup.},

facilitate its automated discovery, to enable its linking to semantically related articles, to provide access to data within the article in
actionable form, and to facilitate integration of data between articles. Recently, semantic publishing has opened the possibility of a
major step forward in the digital publishing world. For this to succeed, new semantic models and visualization tools are required to
fully meet the specific needs of authors and publishers. In this article, we introduce the principles and architectures of two new
ontologies central to the task of semantic publishing: FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, an ontology for recording
and publishing bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours on the Semantic Web, and CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, an
ontology for the characterization of bibliographic citations both factually and rhetorically. We present those two models step by step,
in order to emphasise their features and to stress their advantages relative to other pre-existing information models. Finally, we
review the uptake of FaBiO and CiTO within the academic and publishing communities.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, several ontologies have been introduced for semantic publishing. However, scholarly publishing, like other real-world domains, needs to be described also in terms of precise temporal durations and the particular contexts in which the relevant processes take place. For instance, a document changes status during its publication process, e.g., from "draft" to "submitted" to "under review" to "accepted for publication", and so on. Similarly, one's roles may change with time: one's affiliation with an academic institution or one's role as a journal editor are likely to change over time. Existing well-known ontologies used to describe individuals and bibliographic entities in the Linked Data are currently not able to model situations of temporary or context-dependent possession (e.g., the holding of a status or of a role). In this paper, we address this issue by introducing two ontologies for semantic publishing, the Publishing Roles Ontology and the Publishing Status Ontology, that define the roles of people and the statuses of documents in the scholarly publishing domain.},

The possibility to explore a collection of scientific papers (a digital library, a repository or an archive of data) using different and multiple facets, i.e., different and multiple points of view on the digital collection, increases on the one hand the success of information retrieval and on the other hand the availability of richer data sets. Multiple facets are the natural navigation method made possible by an adequate ontological representation of a class of homogeneous documents. Context and content of published journal articles are thus components that in the representation of information at the metadata level constitute a fundamental approach to semantic enhancement. In this paper we introduced a test in using a particular semantic publishing model, called semantic lenses, to semantically enhance published journal articles.},

  Abstract                 = {Semantic web technologies can support the rapid and trans-
parent validation of scientific claims by interconnecting the assumptions
and evidence used to support or challenge assertions. One important ap-
plication domain is medication safety, where more efficient acquisition,
representation, and synthesis of evidence about potential drug-drug in-
teractions is needed. Potential drug-drug interactions (PDDIs), defined
as two or more drugs for which an interaction is known to be possible,
are a significant source of preventable drug-related harm. The combi-
nation of poor quality evidence on PDDIs, and a general lack of PDDI
knowledge by prescribers, results in many thousands of preventable med-
ication errors each year. While many sources of PDDI evidence exist to
help improve prescriber knowledge, they are not concordant in their cov-
erage, accuracy, and agreement. The goal of this project is to research
and develop core components of a new model that supports more effi-
cient acquisition, representation, and synthesis of evidence about poten-
tial drug-drug interactions. Two Semantic Web models—the Micropub-
lications Ontology and the Open Annotation Data Model—have great
potential to provide linkages from PDDI assertions to their supporting
evidence: statements in source documents that mention data, materials,
and methods. In this paper, we describe the context and goals of our
work, propose competency questions for a dynamic PDDI evidence base,
outline our new knowledge representation model for PDDIs, and discuss
the challenges and potential of our approach.},

  Volume                   = {4},

  Abstract                 = {Background
Current methods of measuring the quality of journals assume that citations of articles within journals are normally distributed. Furthermore using journal impact factors to measure the quality of individual articles is flawed if citations are not uniformly spread between articles. The aim of this study was to assess the distribution of citations to articles and use the level of non-citation of articles within a journal as a measure of quality. This ranking method is compared with the impact factor, as calculated by ISI.

Methods
Total citations gained by October 2003, for every original article and review published in current immunology (13125 articles; 105 journals) and surgical (17083 articles; 120 journals) fields during 2001 were collected using ISI Web of Science.

Results
The distribution of citation of articles within an individual journal is mainly non-parametric throughout the literature. One sixth (16.7\%; IQR 13.6–19.2) of articles in a journal accrue half the total number of citations to that journal. There was a broader distribution of citation to articles in higher impact journals and in the field of immunology compared to surgery. 23.7\% (IQR 14.6–42.4) of articles had not yet been cited. Levels of non-citation varied between journals and subject fields. There was a significant negative correlation between the proportion of articles never cited and a journal's impact factor for both immunology (rho = -0.854) and surgery journals (rho = -0.924).

Conclusion
Ranking journals by impact factor and non-citation produces similar results. Using a non-citation rate is advantageous as it creates a clear distinction between how citation analysis is used to determine the quality of a journal (low level of non-citation) and an individual article (citation counting). Non-citation levels should therefore be made available for all journals.},
