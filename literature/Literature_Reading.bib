  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new map representing the structure of all of science, based on journal articles, including both the natural and social sciences. Similar to cartographic maps of our world, the map of science provides a bird’s eye view of today`s scientific landscape. It can be used to visually identify major areas of science, their size, similarity, and interconnectedness. In order to be useful, the map needs to be accurate on a local and on a global scale. While our recent work has focused on the former aspect,1 this paper summarizes results on how to achieve structural accuracy. Eight alternative measures of journal similarity were applied to a data set of 7,121 journals covering over 1 million documents in the combined Science Citation and Social Science Citation Indexes. For each journal similarity measure we generated two-dimensional spatial layouts using the force-directed graph layout tool, VxOrd. Next, mutual information values were calculated for each graph at different clustering levels to give a measure of structural accuracy for each map. The best co-citation and inter-citation maps according to local and structural accuracy were selected and are presented and characterized. These two maps are compared to establish robustness. The inter-citation map is then used to examine linkages between disciplines. Biochemistry appears as the most interdisciplinary discipline in science.},

  Abstract                 = {Most literature searching in biomedicine is now conducted via PubMed, Google
Scholar or other web-based bibliographic search mechanisms. Yet until now a public, open,
interoperable and complete web-adapted information schema for bibliographic citations,
bibliographic references and scientific discourse has not been available. Such a schema,
expressed in the form of a description logic compatible with current web semantics approaches,
would provide the ability to treat bibliographic references and citations, and rhetorical discourse
in scientific publications, as semantic metadata on the web, with all the benefits that implies for
organization, search and mash-up of web-based scientific information.
In this paper we present CiTO + SWAN, a set of fully harmonized ontology modules resulting
from the harmonization of CiTO (the Citation Typing Ontology) with SWAN (Semantic Web
Applications in Neuromedicine), which we have developed by jointly adapting and evolving
version 1.6 of CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, and version 1.2 of the SWAN Scientific
Discourse Ontology (v1.2). The CiTO + SWAN model is specified in OWL 2 DL, is fully
modular, and inherently supports agent-based searching and mash-ups.
Through the harmonization activity presented here, and previous work that harmonized SWAN
with the SIOC (Semantically-Interlinked Online Communities) Ontology for describing blogs,
wikis and discussion groups, we have construct the basis of a powerful new web framework for
scientific communications.},

This paper introduces OWiki, a framework for creating ontological content within not-natively-semantic wikis. Ontology-driven forms and templates are the key concepts of the system, that allows even inexpert users to create consistent semantic data with little effort. Multiple and very different instances of OWiki are presented here. The expressive power and flexibility of OWiki proved to be the right trade-off to deploy the authoring environments for such very different domains, ensuring at the same time editing freedom and semantic data consistency.},

  Abstract                 = {Overlapping structures in XML are not symptoms of a misunderstanding of the intrinsic characteristics of a text document nor evidence of extreme scholarly requirements far beyond those needed by the most common XML-based applications. On the contrary, overlaps have started to appear in a large number of incredibly popular applications hidden under the guise of syntactical tricks to the basic hierarchy of the XML data format. Unfortunately, syntactical tricks have the drawback that the affected structures require complicated workarounds to support even the simplest query or usage. In this article, we present Extremely Annotational Resource Description Framework (RDF) Markup (EARMARK), an approach to overlapping markup that simplifies and streamlines the management of multiple hierarchies on the same content, and provides an approach to sophisticated queries and usages over such structures without the need of ad-hoc applications, simply by using Semantic Web tools and languages. We compare how relevant tasks (e.g., the identification of the contribution of an author in a word processor document) are of some substantial complexity when using the original data format and become more or less trivial when using EARMARK. We finally evaluate positively the memory and disk requirements of EARMARK documents in comparison to Open Office and Microsoft Word XML-based formats.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present an approach for extending the existing concept of nanopublications — tiny entities of scientific results in RDF representation — to broaden their application range. The proposed extension uses English sentences to represent informal and underspecified scientific claims. These sentences follow a syntactic and semantic scheme that we call AIDA (Atomic, Independent, Declarative, Absolute), which provides a uniform and succinct representation of scientific assertions. Such AIDA nanopublications are compatible with the existing nanopublication concept and enjoy most of its advantages such as information sharing, interlinking of scientific findings, and detailed attribution, while being more flexible and applicable to a much wider range of scientific results. We show that users are able to create AIDA sentences for given scientific results quickly and at high quality, and that it is feasible to automatically extract and interlink AIDA nanopublications from existing unstructured data sources. To demonstrate our approach, a web-based interface is introduced, which also exemplifies the use of nanopublications for non-scientific content, including meta-nanopublications that describe other nanopublications.},

For digital artifacts that are supposed to be immutable, there is moreover no commonly accepted method to enforce this immutability. These shortcomings have a serious negative impact on the ability to reproduce the results of processes that rely on Web resources, which in turn heavily impacts areas such as science where reproducibility is important. To solve this problem, we propose trusty URIs containing cryptographic hash values. We show how trusty URIs can be used for the verification of digital artifacts, in a manner that is independent of the serialization format in the case of structured data files such as nanopublications. We demonstrate how the contents of these files become immutable, including dependencies to external digital artifacts and thereby extending the range of verifiability to the entire reference tree. Our approach sticks to the core principles of the Web, namely openness and decentralized architecture, and is fully compatible with existing standards and protocols. Evaluation of our reference implementations shows that these design goals are indeed accomplished by our approach, and that it remains practical even for very large files.},

facilitate its automated discovery, to enable its linking to semantically related articles, to provide access to data within the article in
actionable form, and to facilitate integration of data between articles. Recently, semantic publishing has opened the possibility of a
major step forward in the digital publishing world. For this to succeed, new semantic models and visualization tools are required to
fully meet the specific needs of authors and publishers. In this article, we introduce the principles and architectures of two new
ontologies central to the task of semantic publishing: FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, an ontology for recording
and publishing bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours on the Semantic Web, and CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, an
ontology for the characterization of bibliographic citations both factually and rhetorically. We present those two models step by step,
in order to emphasise their features and to stress their advantages relative to other pre-existing information models. Finally, we
review the uptake of FaBiO and CiTO within the academic and publishing communities.},

  Abstract                 = {In a move towards an enrichment of the metadata models that are used in the electronic publication of scholarly literature, modern publishers are making steps towards semantic publishing. The possibility to explore a collection of scientific papers (a digital library, a repository or an archive of data) using different and multiple facets, i.e., different and multiple points of view on the digital collection, increases on the one hand the success of information retrieval and on the other hand the availability of richer data sets. Multiple facets are the natural navigation method made possible by an adequate ontological representation of a class of homogeneous documents. Context and content of published journal articles are thus components that in the representation of information at the metadata level constitute a fundamental approach to semantic enhancement. In this paper we introduced a test in using a particular semantic publishing model, called semantic lenses, to semantically enhance published journal articles.},
